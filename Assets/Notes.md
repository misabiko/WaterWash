# TODOs
- 3 Example platforming level
- 2 Make particles look like water
- 2 Normal map to elevate dirt
- 2 Wet mask
	- 2 Water slide after plunge
- 1 Get dirtiness percentage
- 1 Inspect values without adding random field variables
- 1 Vibrate controller on spray
- 1 Press jump during plunge slide to do forward jump
- 1 Keep camera Y still on jump
- 1 Lose momentum on consecutive plunges
- 1 Detect when walking on dirt
	- 0 Slowdown on dirt
	- 0 Damage on dirt?
- 0 Spin jump
- 0 Coyote time (might be weird with capsule collider?)
- 0 Moving platforms
- 0 Debug sprayer object with primitives
- 0 (Gold) Coins or the equivalent
- 0 Swimming
- 0 First person aim mode

## Polishing
- 0 Dirtiness texture

- 0 Keyboard/Mouse camera controls?

## Dunno how to do
- 2 Have dirt mask pixel same size regardless of mesh scale
